commands to run FIRST TIME
$ docker-compose --profile dbs up -d # and ^C once the DBs stopped producing startup logs
# 74 seconds
$ docker-compose --profile dbs --profile tests up -d
# 45 seconds

Then on further uses:
$ ./dev.sh db-start
$ ./dev.sh db-stop
$ ./dev.sh test  # first time will install things for ~60s, after that it will just keep running the tests
