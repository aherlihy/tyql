## Windows 11 tooling

Paste the `prepare.ps1` script into a priviledged PowerShell session once, in a Windows 11 virtual machine.
Then run the tests from some public branch by invoking `download_and_sbt_test.ps1` from an unpriviledged PowerShell session.

For now there is no further automation, as we expect to test on Windows only just before the release.
